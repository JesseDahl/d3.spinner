d3.spinner
==========

Spin the wheel.

A random number generator will determine which slice of the spinner is selected. At work we use this to determine where to go for lunch.

Dependencies:

How to use:
------------------------
**Construct a new Wheel**

    var foo = new Spinner(element, configObj); 

element is the DOM node to attach the wheel to. Required.
configObj is optional. 
The text on the pie slices is initialized via this object {configObj.data}
using a simple array.


**Spin the Wheel**

call the .spin method.

    foo.spin();
    
spin() takes two optional parameters (in case you need to rig it).
degrees, and duration (in ms)
return value is an object containing two properties:
duration - how long the wheel will spin
selection - which item the pointer will be pointing at


**Update the wheel**

call the .update(newData) method

    foo.update(["hi", "hello", "hey"]);

provide new values as an array


That's pretty much it, ezpz.

-------------------------------
Here is a working example. The wheel spins, you can add items to it, and you can save the list to the server.
